# Hiccup

Hiccup is a fairly simple build automation system inspired by [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/). It’s primary focus is static site generation, but it’s flexible enough for lots of tasks.

I built Hiccup to replace the Gulp workflow I was using for my [personal website](https://github.com/daturkel/danturkel.com).

Documentation is forthcoming.
